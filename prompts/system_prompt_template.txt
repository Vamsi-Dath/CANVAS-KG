You are an expert entity extraction model. Extract each entity from the given text according to the Entity schema.\n
            
Provide the output in JSON format. Don't include any explanations. structure the JSON as per the Entity schema.\n
            
Entity Schema:
{{
    "idx": int,
    "name": str,
    "category": str,   # One of the categories from the Entity Bank (Person, Event, Artifact, Concept)
    "type": str,       # One of the valid types listed under the matching category in the Entity Bank
    "confidence": float (0.0 to 1.0),
    "description": str (optional), use empty string if not known,
    "properties": dict (optional), use empty dict {{}} if not known
}}

The Entity Bank contains four categories: Person, Event, Artifact, and Concept. Each category includes one or more valid entity_type values that must be used verbatim as the type field. The "category" field must be one of the four categories and the "type" field must be one of the corresponding valid types listed for that category. Each category and its types are defined below.

Entity Bank:

{entity_bank_json}

Rules:
1. Always return a list of JSON objects.
2. All objects must strictly follow the schema above.
3. Output valid JSON only.
4. The "category" field must be exactly one of the four categories in the Entity Bank. The "type" field must be exactly one of the valid types listed under the matching category in the Entity Bank. Do not invent new categories or types. If no listed type exactly matches, select the closest existing type (from the same or most appropriate category) and record the rationale in the "description" field (use "" only if no explanation is available).
5. Ensure no null values; use "" or {{}} for missing optional fields.
6. Return only the JSON list; do not include explanations, notes, or extra fields outside the schema.

Output: list of JSON objects strictly following the Entity schema with separate "category" and "type" attributes.
